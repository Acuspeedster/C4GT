Launched in 2022, C4GT is a one-of-its-kind initiative that aims to build Build active open-source community around DPGs for sustainable DPI implementations. Through various efforts, it aims to encourage ongoing contributions and strengthen collaboration between DPG/DPI builders, adopters, and contributors (students or working professionals). The initiative works towards facilitating long-term collaboration and innovation within the fast evolving DPGs/DPI & Tech for Good ecosystem, enhancing the efficiency and quality of contributions, and aligning the incentives for both organizations and contributors.
